### The 3-Step Flow:
1.  Player types **`/link`** inside Minecraft.
2.  They receive a short, secret code (e.g., `X9F2`).
3.  They go to your Discord and type **`/link code:X9F2`**.
    <br>
    **Done! Their accounts are permanently connected.**

## 📦 Simple Installation

We believe in "setup and forget" infrastructure.

1.  Drop the **`DiscordLinkerPro.jar`** into your `plugins/` folder.
2.  Restart your server once to generate the config file.
3.  Open `plugins/DiscordLinkerPro/config.yml` and paste your **Discord Bot Token**.
4.  Restart again. **Your infrastructure is online.**
